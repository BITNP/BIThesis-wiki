# 更新说明：−∞ 至2020年10月

## [1.2.0] - 2020-06-01

**Congrats on finishing your thesis! (If not, be quick!)** I recommend using this last template to recompile your LaTeX project, in order to comply with the latest style requirements.

### 🚀 Improvements

- We added support for external mentors. If your final year project needs external mentor cover page support, try compiling the template with `\externalMentorName{}` defined! (Credit @Lancern)
- We added contributing / issue guidelines to our project. (Credit @fky2015)

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- We fixed the template's TeX typesetting parameters to make sure all paragraphs are within the bounding box of the article. (Credit @Lancern)
- We fixed the indentation of the template's TOC according to specifications made by the Dept. of Undergraduate Academic Affairs.
- We polished our Wiki to comply with the latest template.
- We also updated our acknowledgements page! See: [BIThesis - Acknowledgements](https://bithesis.spencerwoo.com/Guide/5-Acknowledgements/Acknowledgements.html).

### 🚀 Improvements

#### Graduation Thesis

- We added `\unnumchapter` command to fix all chapters with no numbering required. (Credits: @Lancern)
- We added numbered sections support for `3_conclusion`, `5_appendix`, and `6_acknowledgements`, and added predefined section formats inside appendix following the guidelines made by BIT. (Credits: @Lancern)

#### Online Wiki / PDF

- We added documentation for the usage of `ntheorem` to define theorem environments in your LaTeX documents. (Credits: @shoopshoop)

### 🐛 Bug fixes

- We fixed an issue in section abstract where clicking on the link in TOC will take you to the cover of the document.
- We fixed an issue where having multi-lined footnotes result in splitting them across 2 separate pages.
- We fixed an issue where macOS / Linux / Overleaf users have an extra blank page at the end of the document. (Credit: @felinae98)
- We noticed an issue where equations have different spacings above and below. However this is an intended feature if you have a blank line before and after your equation inside your LaTeX source code, the correct way to resolve this **is to not have blank lines.** _(Yes we are not kidding.)_

## [1.0.2] - 2020-05-04 {title="🌟 Publish release v1.0.2"}

> More releases, more joy!

### 🐛 Bug fix and improvements

#### Graduation Thesis

- We added support for multiple appendix index numbering as of PR #22 in the format of `附录 A`, `附录 B`, etc.
- We fixed the `\section` numbering for `conclusion`, `reference`, `appendix` and `acknowledgements` as of PR #22
